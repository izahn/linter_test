```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


This repo tries to create the system mentioned in Matthew Salganik's post, "Rapid feedback on code with lintr" (June 9, 2015), https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/rapid-feedback-on-code-with-lintr/


This setup is designed for a potential "programming camp" for students practicing R.
